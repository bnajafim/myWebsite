     <h2>Yerevan</h2>
<p>In 2010, I went to Yerevan  for pleasure. Actually, It was my first trip outside of Iran. From Tehran, it usually takes around 25 hours by bus to reach there. The trip was amazing especially from Armenia border to Yerevan. Almost all the road was located in mountainous places and there was no city in between; I just saw a few villages. Yerevan,  capital of the Republic of Armenia, is a big city governed by the Russian Empire.  Yerevan has many historical, artistic and cultural places. 
</p>

<h2>Republic Square</h2>
<p>One of the most sightseen places in Yerevan is Republic Square. The square was built in 1925. This place attracts many tourists every year and it is one of the most crowded places in Yerevan. This square is surrounded by Government buildings and the National Gallery. The buildings made of reddish and yellowish bricks that make it eye-catching for the viewer.  
     The square has oval-shaped square and paved with stones in the center, meant to look like a traditional Armenian carpet from above. The beautiful dancing water fountains are located in front of the National Gallery. The clock of the Government building tower was made in Moscow and transferred to Yerevan in July 1941. </p>
     
     <h2> Cascade</h2>
     <p>Another attraction hub is the Cascade, which is a giant stairway in Yerevan. The construction of the cascade was launched in 1971  and took around 10 years to be completed.
          The Cascade has interior and exterior sections wich both are amazing. The interior which is underneath the exterior has a couple of levels. Each level connected to each other by escalator. In total there was around 10 escalator. In addition to Cafesjian Museum of Art ,on each level, there were some paintings for a display to the people. 
          The exterior of the cascade, has no escalators. However, it has stairs has multiple levels with fountains and sculptures. At the top of the cascade, people can enjoy a fantastic view of the city.
