     <h2>Istanbul</h2>

<p>In spring 2014, I visited Istanbul; the direct flight from Canada to Istanbul took around 10 hours.  it was in spring and the whether was just perfect. Istanbul is the most populous city in Turkey, and the country's economic, cultural, and historic center. The Bosphorus strait between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea has divided the Istanbul to Asian and European sections. Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side, and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side. That was one of my most memorable trip I have ever had. I never forgot the delicious food there. </p>

<h2>Sultan Ahmed Mosque</h2>

<p>There are some mosques that are popular in Istanbul. These mosques have a kind of unique structure and you can see many similarities among them. The Sultan Ahmed Mosque or Sultan Ahmet Mosque, especially is a historic mosque in Istanbul. The mosque is popularly known as the Blue Mosque for the blue tiles adorning the walls of its interior. Mosqes in Istanbul usually contain a couple of doms on top of each other that make them unique, and mostly they were  located close to each other on the European side.</p>

<h2> Galata Tower</h2>

<p>The Galata Tower was one of the places that I really enjoyed in Istanbul. It is a high, cone-capped cylinder with nine-story. It is one of the city's tallest structure which has an external diameter at the base, with really thick walls. There is a restaurant and caf√© on its upper floors which command a magnificent view of Istanbul and the Bosphorus. Also located on the upper floors is a night club which hosts a Turkish show. There are two operating elevators that carry visitors from the lower level to the upper levels. </p>
