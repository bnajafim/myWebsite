<h2> CN Tower</h2>
 <p>I believe CN tower is the symbol of Toronto. The construction on the CN Tower began on February 6, 1973, with massive excavations at the tower base for the foundation.  It is now the 3rd tallest tower in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere. CN Tower which is located in downtown Toronto and surrounded by so many massive and tall buildings, is a signature icon of Toronto's skyline attracting  millions international visitors annually</p>

<h2>Niagara Falls</h2>
<p><p>Niagara Falls is the most beautiful waterfall in the world which is located between Canada and the United States, more specifically, between the province of Ontario and the state of New York. There are two cities called Nigra Fall in both countries and the Canadian Nigra Fall city is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. This city has many attractions such as entertainment places, bars, casinos, hotels, restaurants, and etc. From largest to smallest, the three waterfalls are the Horseshoe Falls, the American Falls and the Bridal Veil Falls. The Horseshoe Falls lie mostly on the Canadian side and the American Falls entirely on the American side, separated by Goat Island. The smaller Bridal Veil Falls are also located on the American side, separated from the other waterfalls by Luna Island. </p>

<h2>Muskoka</h2>

<p><p> Muskoka, largest population center in Huntsville, is a Regional Municipality located approximately a two-hour car drive north of Toronto and spans 6,475 km2 (2,500 sq mi). I believe Muskoka is one of the unique places in the world with more than 1,600 lakes, making it a popular cottaging destination. It has more than 2.1 million visitors annually. Muskoka has many islands which cover with water and the only way to get there is a boat.</p>
